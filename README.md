# Game made with SDL2 and Lua

![Game Image]( images/img-game-1.png )

A simple game that I learned in the [Fundamentals of 2D Game Engines with C++ SDL and Lua]( https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-2d-game-engine/ ) course. In the game i use SDL2 for the game engine, and Lua for data and script loading.

In the future, I plan to create create a map editor for the game, using C ++ and SDL2.

1. [SDL2]( https://www.libsdl.org/ )

In the folder assets/scripts is the lua files.
In lib folder are the files of GLM and Lua. in the lib/lua folder are de files for Lua and single file sol.
